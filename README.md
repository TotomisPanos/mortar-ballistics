Overview

This project is a Next.js application designed to simulate and visualize mortar ballistics with realistic physics, including:

Projectile motion with air resistance

Wind influence on trajectory

Customizable parameters (velocity, launch angle, wind speed/direction, projectile mass)

Dynamic DOS-style UI with a retro military theme

Real-time graph updates using Chart.js

🚀 Features

Adjustable sliders for:

Initial velocity (m/s)

Launch angle (°)

Wind speed (m/s)

Wind direction (°) with a rotating arrow indicator

Projectile mass & size (coming soon)

Fixed-axis trajectory visualization for better analysis

Air resistance modeling using Newton’s Drag Equation

Wind influence on horizontal and vertical motion

Realistic numerical simulation using Euler’s method

🛠️ Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mortar-ballistics.git
cd mortar-ballistics

Install dependencies:

npm install

Run the development server:

npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

📜 Ballistics Model

This app simulates mortar projectile motion considering:

Gravity (9.81 m/s²)

Air drag based on:

Drag coefficient (spherical projectile ~0.47)

Air density (1.225 kg/m³ at sea level)

Cross-sectional area (πr²)

Wind components:

Wind X-component affects horizontal motion.

Wind Y-component affects vertical lift or downward push.

Numerical Integration:

Euler’s Method is used for realistic motion updates.

🎨 UI & Styling

Retro DOS-style UI with green monochrome text

TailwindCSS for styling

Custom sliders for smooth adjustments

Real-time updates with no need for a submit button

Chart.js visualization of projectile trajectory
